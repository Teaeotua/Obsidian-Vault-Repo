Learned about Linux distributions like Arch, Ubuntu, Kali. Plus, Guacamole. not the one with avocados, you can use this one for remote control all your devices. great for SSH.

#### Arch
Arch is one of the more exciting one since it almost doesn't tell you what to do, it's like building the system by yourself or building a Lego death star without any instructions.   

#### Ubuntu
Ubuntu is one of the alternatives of Windows, it's actually so similar to Windows that it also steals your information.

#### Mint
Another windows alternative, easy to use and understand.

#### Kali
Great for Pentesting and Networking features.
