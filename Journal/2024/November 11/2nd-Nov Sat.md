TryHackMe challenge is about to end, couple days remained. I am actually kinda stressed, i really want to win something tho there is not enough time for everything.
Weekends supposed to be weekends right, I should take some time off. But it's not like that anymore. I work more on weekends since I'm off the school and all that.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy learning, you know it very well, both as an anon and an anarchist. knowledge is power. So, have as much as you can and when you have enough, give back to community.
