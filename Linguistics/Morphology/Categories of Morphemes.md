_Morphemes are the smallest units of meaning or grammatical function within a language_. The two main categories, free and bound morphemes, each have two sub-categories under them: 

### Categories of free morphemes

#### Lexical morphemes

Morphemes that carry the content or meaning of the messages that we are conveying. In order to identify a lexical morpheme, ask yourself this: “If this morpheme was deleted, would I not be able to understand the main message of this sentence?” If the answer is yes, then you have a lexical morpheme.

Examples of lexical morphemes: follow, type, look, yellow, act, pick, strange

#### Functional morphemes

Morphemes that do not carry the content of a message, but rather help the grammar of the sentence function. These free morphemes can be identified by asking yourself this question: “If this morpheme was deleted, would I still be able to understand the main message of this sentence?” If the answer is yes, then you have a functional morpheme.

Examples of functional morphemes: but, when, near, above, in, the, that, them, if

### Categories of bound morphemes

#### Derivational morphemes

Morphemes that transform words into different grammatical categories from the root word (a free morpheme). These morphemes transform words into [different parts of speech](https://www.eslbasics.com/blog/student-posts/what-are-the-8-parts-of-speech/). In order to identify a derivational morpheme, ask yourself this question: “If this morpheme was added, would it change the part of speech of this word?” If the answer is yes, then you have a derivational morpheme.

Examples of derivational morphemes: -ful, -ness, -less, -ly, -y, -ish, -ment

care = noun  
care + _ful_ = adjective

Kind = adjective  
kind + _ness_ = noun

#### Inflectional morphemes

Morphemes that indicate aspects of the grammatical function of a word, such as changing a word into a plural or possessive form. In order to identify an inflectional morpheme, ask yourself this: “By adding this bound morpheme, does it keep the word in the same grammatical category, but change some aspect of it?” If the answer is yes, then you have an inflectional morpheme. English only has 8 inflectional morphemes.

Examples of inflectional morphemes: 

Nouns: -‘s, ‘s  
Verbs: -s, -ing, -ed, -en  
Adjectives: -er, -est

_The teacher’s frankness shocked the boy’s parents._ 

Now, see if you can determine what type of morphemes are in the sentence. There are 13 total morphemes. When you’re ready to check your answer, read the correct response below. 

**Answer:**  
The – functional  
teach – lexical  
-er – derivational  
‘s – inflectional  
frank – lexical  
-ness – derivational  
shock – lexical  
-ed – inflectional  
the – functional  
boy – lexical  
‘s – inflectional  
parent – lexical  
-s – inflectional

### Allomorphs

[Allomorphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allomorph "Allomorph") are variants of a morpheme that differ in form but are semantically similar. For example, the English plural [marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_(linguistics) "Marker (linguistics)") has three allomorphs: /-z/ (_bug**s**_), /-s/ (_bat**s**_), or /-ɪz, -əz/ (_bus**es**_). An allomorph is a concrete realization of a morpheme, which is an abstract unit. That is parallel to the relation of an [allophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone "Allophone") and a [phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme "Phoneme"). *vowel harmony variations in Turkish can be an example for allomorphs.*

### Zero-morpheme


A [zero morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_morpheme "Zero morpheme") is a type of morpheme that carries [semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics "Semantics") meaning but is not represented by [auditory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system "Auditory system") phoneme. A word with a zero-morpheme is analyzed as having the morpheme for grammatical purposes, but the morpheme is not realized in speech. They are often represented by /[∅](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%85 "∅")/ within [glosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloss_(annotation) "Gloss (annotation)").
