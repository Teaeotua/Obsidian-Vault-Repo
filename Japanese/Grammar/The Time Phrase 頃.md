｜時《とき》 is by far the most basic and utilized word for expressing “when,” but there also exists ｜頃《ころ》. 頃 has three main usages, of which, its primary usage overlaps with 時.  
  
頃 may broadly refer to a particular time period while also encompassing before and after it, making it a vaguer version of 時.  
Also seen as ｜頃合《ころあ》い, it may refer to the most opportune time.  
In the phrase ｜年の頃《としのころ》, it may refer to approximate age.

**Orthography Notes**:  
- ころ, as well as its suffixal form ～ごろ, may be frequently seen spelled either in Hiragana or Kanji. Both are used interchangeably.  
- ～時 may also be spelled in Hiragana or Kanji, but in practice, its Hiragana spelling is far more common.

### Scenario I: As Standalone Nouns

When a noun can stand alone, it will most likely fall under the category of 実質名詞, which in other words, is a noun which refers to an actual ‘thing/entity.’  
  
In this scenario, 時 defaults to meaning “time.”  
  
1. 時は金なり[1](https://imabi.org/time-phrases-%e3%81%ab/#1630d674-d968-46b3-b162-87bcea93ccc1)。  
Time is money.  
  
頃, however, is often described as not being able to stand alone except in rare circumstances, all of which could be described as set phrases. Here in Ex. 2, 頃 is synonymous with 時代.  
  
2. 頃は元禄十四年師走半ばの十四日・・・  
It was the Genroku Period Year 14 in the middle of the twelfth month (of the lunar calendar) on the 14th…  
  
3. 頃（合い）を見計らって顔を出す。  
To find the right time and make an appearance.
