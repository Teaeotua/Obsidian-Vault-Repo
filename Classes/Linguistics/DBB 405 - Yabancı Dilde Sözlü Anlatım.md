## Phoneme
- The smallest of a word that can make a difference in meaning which can distinguish two words
- **pat /pæt/** and **cat /kæt/** differ only in their initial sounds.
- Therefore, **/p/** and **/k/** are phonemes of English.

The number of phonemes varies from one language to another.
English is often considered to have 44 phonemes: 24 consonants and 20 vowels.

Vowel phonemes
/æ, eɪ, i:, e, ɪ, aɪ, ɒ, oʊ, ʊ, ʌ, u:, ɔɪ, aʊ, ə, eə, ɑ:, ɜ:, ɔ:, ɪə, ʊə/

Consonant phonemes
/b, d, f, g, h, dʒ, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, z, ʒ, tʃ, ʃ, θ, ð, ŋ, j/

### Vowel
They are sounds in which there is no obstruction to the flow of air as it passes from the larynx to the lips.

British short vowels
/æ/, /e/, /ɪ/, /ɒ/, /ʊ/, /ʌ/, /ə/

respectively; pat, pet, pit, pot, put, putt, about

English long vowels
/i:/, /u:/, /ɑ:/, /ɜ:/, /ɔ:/

key, cool, car, cur, core

## English diphthongs

There are two types of diphthongs in English; centering and closing
See them in [[English Diphthongs.canvas|English Diphthongs]]

## Language learning skills

There are 2 different directions in language learning which are referred as **productive** (such as writing and speech) and **receptive** (reading and listening)

Channel is another important idea which refers to the medium of the message. Thus, speaking is the productive aural/oral skill. It consists of producing systematic verbal utterances.

Teaching speaking can be considered a simple process.
Schools hire untrained people to teach conversation. although speaking is totally natural, speaking in a language other than our own is anything but simple.

**Spoken language:**
auditory, Temporary, Prosody, Immediate feedback, Planning and editing is limited by channel

**Written language:**
Visual, Permanent, Punctuation, Delayed or no feedback Unlimited planning, editing, revision.

By **Audiolingual repetition**, it's aimed to teach students the target language
But actual conversations didn't sound like the textbook dialogues.
as a result a method called communicative language teaching emerged.
#### Communicative language teaching (CLT)

in the **weak version** of CLT, Student starts with the grammar teachings and carry on with communication practices.

Whereas the **strong version** is only about the communication, no text-book or grammar teaching is practiced

## Speech production
Speech production involves the entire process of transforming thought into spoken language. It typically involves several stages: from initial idea formation (conceptualization) to organizing words and grammar (formulation), physical production of sound (articulation), and self-checking for errors (self-monitoring and repair). Proficient speakers often develop automaticity in this process, which enables fluent and natural speech.
## Conceptualization and formulation
In the conceptualization stage, a speaker develops an idea or intention to communicate. Formulation involves selecting appropriate words and organizing them according to grammatical rules to convey the intended meaning. It’s a crucial part of fluent speech, especially when we consider how we adapt language in real time, such as in conversations or complex narratives.
## Articulation
Articulation is the physical production of speech sounds. It relies on the coordination of various muscles and organs—like the tongue, lips, and vocal cords. Precision in articulation is key to being understood clearly by listeners and is foundational in language teaching, especially for learners developing accuracy in a new language.
## Self-monitoring and repair
This aspect involves the speaker's ability to detect and correct errors in real-time. Self-monitoring is critical for effective communication as it allows speakers to adjust or repair their speech if something goes wrong. Errors might include mispronunciations, incorrect grammar, or inappropriate word choices, all of which can interrupt comprehension.
## Automaticity
Automaticity refers to the ability to perform certain speech processes without conscious effort. When speakers reach automaticity, they can focus on the content rather than the mechanics of speech, enabling faster, more natural communication. This is a hallmark of fluency and is often developed through practice and repeated exposure.
## Fluency
Fluency encompasses smooth, efficient, and uninterrupted speech. It includes both cognitive fluency, the ease of accessing and generating language, and motor fluency, the physical smoothness of speech production. Fluency is often seen as a key goal in language teaching because it contributes significantly to the natural flow of conversation.
## Managing Talk
Managing talk involves strategies for effective conversation management. This includes turn-taking, topic initiation, and closing, as well as adapting one’s language to suit different social contexts. Managing talk effectively is essential for maintaining coherent and socially appropriate interactions.

## Misc. Terms

- **Communicative Competence**: Refers to the ability to use language effectively and appropriately in various social contexts. It’s a foundational concept in language teaching, emphasizing not just grammar but also social aspects of language use.

- **Accuracy and Fluency**: These are two essential goals in language learning. Accuracy focuses on correct language usage, while fluency emphasizes smooth and natural speech production. Teachers often balance these in lesson planning.

- **Back-Channelling**: This term refers to the verbal and non-verbal cues listeners use to show they are paying attention (e.g., nodding or saying "uh-huh"). It's crucial for maintaining conversational flow and engagement.

- **Turn-Taking**: Essential for managing talk, turn-taking is the process by which speakers coordinate who speaks next. In language teaching, helping learners understand turn-taking conventions is important for natural interactions.

- **Interactional vs. Transactional Talk**: Interactional talk focuses on socializing and maintaining relationships (e.g., casual conversations), while transactional talk is about exchanging information or completing tasks (e.g., giving directions).

- **Formulaic Language**: These are fixed expressions or “chunks” of language that often appear in conversation (e.g., "How are you?" or "Nice to meet you"). They are essential for fluency and are learned as whole units rather than as individual words.

- **Paralinguistics**: Refers to the non-verbal elements of communication, such as tone, pitch, and body language. These elements play a significant role in how messages are interpreted.

- **Recast**: A technique in language teaching where a teacher repeats a student’s error in the correct form, subtly prompting self-correction.

- **Communicative Strategies**: These are techniques speakers use to overcome communication challenges, such as paraphrasing when they lack vocabulary or using gestures to convey meaning.
