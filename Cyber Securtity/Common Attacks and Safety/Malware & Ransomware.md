Malware is often used to perform a set of tasks referred to as "Command and Control" (or C2/C&C). C2 malware connects back to a waiting server and allows an attacker to control the infected system remotely, often incorporating many simple tasks such as keylogging as built-in parts of the malicious software.

# Ransomware 

A specialised class of malware: ransomware is used to infect as many systems as possible, encrypting the data on the devices and holding it to ransom. If the victims pay the attackers within a set timeframe (usually via a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin), the data is _theoretically_ returned.

With the ransom paid, the malware may or may not decrypt the data and self-destruct, depending entirely on how nice the attackers are.

# Delivery Methods

However, there are situations in which a user may genuinely wish to execute macros, and a good attacker will capitalise on these pretexts to convince the victim to click the button.

Similarly, the attacker may send the file as a compiled `.exe`, a PDF, a `.ps1` PowerShell Script or `.bat` Batch script, an HTML application file (`.hta`), or even a `.js` JavaScript file to be executed by the JavaScript interpreter built into Windows.

Alternatively, the attacker may exploit a vulnerability in public-facing infrastructure in a corporate environment (for example, a webserver), thus giving themselves an opening into the internal network and allowing them to start a larger attack, facilitated by malware.

*Note: If you or your business get infected with ransomware, do not power the infected device off, as this can sometimes destroy any potential opportunities to decrypt the data without paying.*
