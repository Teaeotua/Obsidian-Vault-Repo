Backups are arguably the single most important defensive measure you can take to protect your data. No matter what happens, if you have taken appropriate steps to back your information up, you will always be able to recover almost regardless of the severity of the damage.**The Golden 3,2,1 Rule**

The golden standard for taking backups is relatively simple and is often called the "3,2,1 rule".

The 3,2,1 rule specifies that:  

You should always keep at least **three** up-to-date copies of your data; this can include the original copy, but all copies must be maintained.  

Backups should be stored on at least **two** different storage mediums; for example: a cloud backup and a USB device. This can include a hard drive on your PC.  

**One** (or more) backups should be stored "off-site". Cloud services such as Google Drive are ideal for personal use in this regard.

Personally, I'd recommend to store your low-weight or work data on [GitHub](https://github.com/)It's easy to use, encrypted (to some level, not sure)
