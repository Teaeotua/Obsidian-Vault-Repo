Networks are simply things connected. For example, your friendship circle: you are all connected because of similar interests, hobbies, skills and sorts. 
In computing, networking is the same idea, just dispersed to technological devices. Take your phone as an example; the reason that you have it is to access things. We'll cover how these devices communicate with each other and the rules that follow.

Networks are integrated into our everyday life. Be it gathering data for the weather, delivering electricity to homes or even determining who has the right of way at a road. Because networks are so embedded in the modern-day, networking is an essential concept to grasp in cybersecurity.

Networks come in all shapes and sizes, Just like boobs.

# What is the Internet?

The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself.

The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the **W**orld **W**ide **W**eb (**WWW**). It wasn't until this point that the Internet started to be used as a repository for storing and sharing information, just like it is today.

The Internet is made up of many small networks all joined together.  These small networks are called private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks -- or the Internet! So, to recap, a network can be one of two types:  

- A private network  
    
- A public network

Devices will use a set of labels to identify themselves on a network, which we will come onto in the task below.

# Identifying Devices

Devices on a network are very similar to humans in the fact that we have two ways of being identified:

- Our Name
- Our Fingerprints

Now we can change our name through deed poll, but we can't, however, change our fingerprints. Every human has an individual set of fingerprints which means that even if they change their name, there is still an identity behind it. Devices have the same thing: two means of identification, with one being permeable. These are:

- An IP Address
- A Media Access Control (MAC) Address -- think of this as being similar to a serial number.
