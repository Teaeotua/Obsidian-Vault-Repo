# What is Phishing?

Phishing is a sub-section of social engineering. Whereas social engineering is a very general term used to describe any attack that takes advantage of a human rather than a computer system, phishing specifically describes attacks whereby a scammer or other attacker tricks a victim into opening a malicious webpage by sending them a text message, email, or another form of online correspondence.
##### There are three primary types of phishing attacks:

| General Phishing | A simple, mass phishing attack which doesn't target anyone in particular, although they may aim for large groups (e.g. PayPal users, or Amazon customers). These large-scale campaigns are usually simple and are generally (but not always) fairly easy to spot as the messages and malicious sites are often not very well crafted and frequently contain many immediately visible errors. |
| Spearphishing    | More targeted than general phishing, spearphishing aims for an individual or small group (e.g. employees of a specific company). Spearphishing campaigns are generally better crafted than the correspondence and malicious sites used in general phishing as they are designed to target a particular group, often as part of a more extensive campaign against the target.                 |
| Whaling          | Even more specific than spearphishing, whaling targets high-value individuals (e.g. a C-Suite executive in a target company). The messages are generally extremely well crafted and tend to be very hard to spot.                                                                                                                                                                            |
Phishing attacks work best when the malicious web page mimics an existing (usually well-known) web page. For this reason, attackers/scammers will usually use one of many freely available tools to simply clone an existing page, which can then be edited at their leisure.  

# Identifying Phishing Attacks

As a real-world example from 2021, a group of scammers sent out a mass phishing campaign over SMS, mimicking the British Royal Mail service and using the domain name `https://royalmai1.co.uk` (as opposed to `https://royalmail.co.uk`). By exchanging the final "`L`" for the number one, the scammers were able to successfully register a domain name that looked almost identical to the domain name of their cloned website; this is a very common tactic.

Also, bear in mind that HTML emails (effectively any email that looks fancy and contains formatting/graphics) can also be used to mask the real domain name in use. For example, the text in the email may be "`https://amazon.co.uk`"; however, the link _actually_ goes to "`https://am4zon.co.uk`". You can see this by hovering your mouse over the link in a desktop application — the real link should appear at the bottom of the screen.

In a similar vein, the "From" email address in an email-based phishing campaign will often be suspicious. Many generic mass phishing campaigns will simply use Gmail addresses — **not bothering to use a domain name associated with the company they are spoofing**. This is a dead giveaway that the email is suspicious.
