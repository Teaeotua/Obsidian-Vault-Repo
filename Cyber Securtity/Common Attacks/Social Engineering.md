# Social Engineering

Social Engineering is the term used to describe any cyberattack where a _human_ (rather than a computer) is the target; for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as "People Hacking". For example, if an attacker wishes to obtain a victim's password, they _could_ attempt to guess or brute-force the password — _or_ they could [simply ask you](https://youtu.be/opRMrEfAIiI?t=42).

The best way to understand social engineering is to see it in action! These videos from [Defcon23](https://youtu.be/fHhNWAKw0bY?t=100) (one of the largest hacking conferences in the world) and [CNN](https://youtu.be/PWVN3Rq4gzw) demonstrate some of the immense power in social engineering. They are both well worth a watch!

# Other Forms of Social Engineering

 Whilst direct interaction with targets is the most common style of social engineering, other examples include dropping USB storage devices in public (e.g. in company car parks) in the hope that someone (often a company employee) will pick one up and plug it into a sensitive computer. In a similar vein, attackers may leave a "charging cable" plugged into a socket in a public place. In actuality, the cable contains malicious software such as keyloggers or tools to take control of the victim's device.
 
In short, the limits to social engineering are at the bounds of an attacker's imagination. A good social engineer can (and will) use a plethora of psychological tricks under any plausible context to "hack" their targets.
###### _Case Study: Stuxnet (Click to Read)  
  
Stuxnet was the name given to a particularly nasty computer virus (allegedly developed by the governments of the United States and Israel) that was originally used to target the Iran nuclear programme in 2009. Due to its ability as a "worm" to self-replicate (i.e. clone itself across networks — including the internet), the virus escaped and became much more widespread than was intended. Multiple variants now also exist, making Stuxnet a particularly hard-hitting and notorious weapon. You can read more about the background of Stuxnet [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220625202749/https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-center/threat-profiles/ics-malware-variants/stuxnet).  

What makes Stuxnet particularly interesting for this section is the original method of infection. The virus can clone itself across networks, but that doesn't help much when the target network is a nuclear weapons development facility with no access to the wider internet. The question became: how can you get a virus into a network that doesn't let anything in or out? The answer was simple: drop malicious USB devices in places where workers at companies that dealt with the facility would find them and hope that one of them plugged the device into a work computer. In this case, the gamble worked, with Stuxnet causing severe damage to the Iran nuclear programme and effectively destroying many of the nuclear centrifuges.
# Staying Safe from Social Engineering Attacks

In many ways, it is very tricky to stay safe from social engineering as it won't always be _you_ who the attacker is talking to, but rather someone who can give them what they need without your consent (e.g. calling your bank whilst pretending to _be_ you, so as to access your bank account). That said, there are still measures you can take to protect yourself from Social Engineering attacks:

- Always make sure to set up multiple forms of authentication, and ensure that providers respect these. For example, set difficult to guess — or otherwise incorrect — answers to security questions (making sure to store the answers somewhere safe!), and make sure that these questions are asked when you try to access accounts over the phone.
- Never plug external media (e.g. USBs/CDs/etc) into a computer that you care about or that is connected to any other devices. Ideally, don't plug the media in at all, and instead give it to your local police for safekeeping.
- Always insist on proof of identity when a stranger calls or messages you claiming to work for a company whose services you use. Where possible, confirm with a known phone number or email address that the call or message you received was legitimate (i.e. use a trusted method to get in contact with the company to confirm). Remember that no legitimate employee will ever ask for your password or other information that protects your account.
